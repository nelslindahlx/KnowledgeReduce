        "# Code Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook encapsulates an end-to-end pipeline designed for the meticulous extraction, processing, and systematic organization of data from specified web sources into a well-structured knowledge graph. The workflow is outlined in detailed steps, each contributing to the creation of a refined and informative dataset:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries\n",
        "- Installation of pivotal Python libraries such as `requests` for web scraping, `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing, `networkx` for graph-based operations, and `spacy` for advanced natural language processing tasks.\n",
        "- Code to restart the runtime\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 2: Import Libraries and Define Classes\n",
        "- Incorporation of essential Python modules and the establishment of two foundational classes:\n",
        "  - `ReliabilityRating`: An enumeration (Enum) for classifying the reliability of the extracted information.\n",
        "  - `KnowledgeGraph`: A versatile class for constructing and managing a knowledge graph, encompassing functionalities for adding facts, computing and updating quality scores, and fact retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 3: Scrape Data from Websites\n",
        "- Automated retrieval and parsing of HTML content from two distinct websites, methodically extracting textual data from common HTML elements like paragraphs, headings, and lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 4: Populate the KnowledgeGraph\n",
        "- Initialization and population of the `KnowledgeGraph` instance.\n",
        "- Systematic incorporation of each fact into the graph, complete with comprehensive attributes including statement, category, tags, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 5: Display Extracted Facts\n",
        "- Presentation of an initial subset of facts from the knowledge graph, providing insights into the nature of the extracted data and a count of the total facts obtained.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 6: Ensure Data Uniqueness\n",
        "- A focused effort to eliminate duplicate facts from the knowledge graph based on their statements, ensuring the uniqueness and quality of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 7: Implement Advanced Data Cleaning\n",
        "- Advanced data cleaning procedures, including the removal of overly brief facts and deduplication of semantically similar facts through basic string comparison techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 8: Execute Super Aggressive Advanced Cleaning\n",
        "- Application of the `en_core_web_md` spaCy model for sophisticated NLP operations.\n",
        "- Removal of facts based on complex criteria like semantic similarity, leveraging NLP techniques for enhanced dataset refinement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 9: Serialize the KnowledgeGraph for Portability\n",
        "- A crucial step focusing on rendering the Knowledge Graph portable via serialization into JSON format, facilitating easy storage, transfer, and reconstruction across different environments. The process encompasses both serialization and deserialization functions, updated to include sharding for every 100 records.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Step 10: List JSON Files\n",
        "- A utility step for listing available JSON files, ensuring accessibility and management of serialized data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This comprehensive pipeline effectively transforms web-sourced information into a structured, clean, and semantically rich knowledge graph dataset. It is particularly suited for scenarios demanding high data quality and structure, enriched with advanced NLP techniques to ensure a dataset devoid of redundancies and abundant in diverse, valuable insights."

            "Fact 3: This book was published in 2006. It has a formal copyright. You can buy a physical copy if you want or just read it online here. I was going to update this to be an online PDF, but it seemed like a better idea to just make it a very large single page of prose. Enjoy!\n",
            "Fact 4: Dr. Nels Lindahl, June 14, 2020, Denver, Colorado\n",
            "Fact 5: Believing in a dream like graduation with civic honors is only the first step in the process toward advocating the creation of a graduation with civic honors program.\n",
            "Fact 6: The story behind graduation with civic honors began in an academic setting during the spring semester of 2002 at the University of Kansas. I took a class from Dr. H. George Frederickson entitled Concepts of Civil Society. During the Concepts of Civil Society class, my collegiate interests focused on civic engagement. At one point during the class, Dr. Frederickson posed a question to the class about what colleges could do to get people involved within the community. Over the course of the next year thinking about the idea of civil society, I became interested in pursuing a degree in the field of public administration. Thanks to the faculty of the Public Administration Department at the University of Kansas, I decided to endeavor to enter graduate school. I would like to thank Dr. Raymond Davis for advice and guidance, Dr. Thomas Longoria for defining the importance of collaboration, and Dr. H. George Frederickson for a thoughtful introduction to the world of civil society.\n",
            "Fact 7: Graduation with civic honors was only a dream until late in 2002. Dr. Charles J. Carlsen, the president of Johnson County Community College, learned of the idea from Susan Lindahl and, along with the board of trustees and civic honors steering committee, envisioned becoming the first community college in the state of Kansas to designate a graduation with civic honors. In 2004, after Johnson County Community College developed the initial graduation with civic honors pilot program, the next step was to start spreading the graduation with civic honors message. I was honored to submit an article with Dr. Charles J. Carlsen and Susan Lindahl entitled, “Civic Honors Program at Johnson County Community College,” to the Journal for Civic Commitment for publication. The resulting publication (Carlsen, Lindahl, & Lindahl, 2004) was the first step toward globally sharing the positive message of graduation with civic honors.\n",
            "Fact 8: To realize the dream, students actually would have to graduate with civic honors. During the May 2005 graduation at Johnson County Community College, the dream became a reality when four students—including Deborah DeGrate, Carrie Donham, Chris Engle, and Jennifer Pittman-Leeper—were the first to graduate with civic honors. The story will be complete when students all over the world are graduating with civic honors.\n",
            "Fact 9: Society has experienced a true revival of public interest in civic engagement.\n",
            "Fact 10: Robert Putnam’s (2000) epic work Bowling Alone brought the idea of civic participation to the forefront of the public mind. The value of civic participation is essential to the process of value implementation in the form of civic engagement. Civic engagement is a value choice, and the implementation of that value choice is individual civic participation in the community. One of the most basic definitions of civic engagement involves thinking about how government, society, and citizens interact. In terms of how scholars discuss civic engagement, the definition takes on a benevolent feel, referencing citizen activities that benefit civil society. Strengthening civic engagement, in practice, involves building civic skills, increasing active voter participation, and using public service announcements to encourage volunteering to strengthen civil society. Watershed events like 9-11 have created a reflective sense of national interest and significantly increased the willingness of individuals to participate in civic engagement.\n"

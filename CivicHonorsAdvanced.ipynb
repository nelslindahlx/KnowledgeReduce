        "# Code Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The updated code for analyzing webpage content, designed for execution in a Google Colab notebook, is a comprehensive process that combines web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and data organization techniques. The code is structured to run step-by-step, facilitating easy understanding and debugging. Here's a summary of the updated process:\n",
        "\n",
        "Setup: The code starts with the installation of necessary Python packages, including spacy for NLP tasks and en_core_web_sm, a Spacy model for English language processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Import Libraries: Essential Python libraries such as requests for fetching webpage content, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, spacy and Matcher for NLP and pattern matching, and Counter from the collections module for data organization are imported.\n",
        "\n",
        "Function Definitions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Fetch Webpage Content: This function retrieves the HTML content of the specified URL (https://civichonors.com/) and uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML, extracting the main textual content.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Enhanced Map Phase Function: In this function, the Spacy NLP library is used to process the extracted text. It includes extracting noun chunks, named entities, verbs, and identifying specific patterns (like a noun followed by a verb) using Spacy's Matcher. This comprehensive analysis helps in understanding the structure and content of the webpage.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Updated Shuffle and Sort Function: This function organizes the extracted data by counting occurrences (using Counter) of noun chunks, named entities, and verbs, and creates a set of unique relations identified in the text. This step prepares the data for more detailed analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Advanced Reduce Phase Function: This phase focuses on reducing the data to its most significant elements, such as the most common noun chunks, named entities, and verbs. It provides a summarized view of the key elements in the webpage content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Execution and Output:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The final execution step involves running the content fetching, mapping, shuffling and sorting, and reducing functions in sequence.\n",
        "* The output is displayed in an organized manner, with each category (relations, top noun chunks, named entities, and verbs) printed line by line, providing a clear and detailed overview of the webpage's content.\n",
        "\n",
        "This updated code offers a deep dive into the webpage's content, leveraging NLP to extract and analyze key linguistic elements and patterns. It's particularly useful for content analysis, thematic exploration, and understanding the structure and context of web-based text."

# KnowledgeReduce System Architecture

## Overview

The KnowledgeReduce system is designed to efficiently build and maintain a database of facts by adapting the MapReduce paradigm for knowledge graph construction. The system processes diverse data sources, extracts entities and relationships, and aggregates them into a comprehensive knowledge graph.

## System Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **Data Source Connectors**: Interfaces for various data sources (web, documents, databases)
- **Data Preprocessing Module**: Handles normalization, cleaning, and standardization
- **Data Quality Validator**: Ensures data meets quality standards before processing

### 2. Mapping Layer (Entity and Relationship Extraction)
- **Entity Recognition Engine**: Identifies entities from structured and unstructured data
- **Relationship Extractor**: Determines relationships between identified entities
- **Intermediate Representation Generator**: Creates key-value pairs for the reduce phase
- **Disambiguation Module**: Resolves entity ambiguities using context and reference data

### 3. Reducing Layer (Knowledge Aggregation)
- **Entity Aggregator**: Combines information about the same entities from different sources
- **Conflict Resolution Engine**: Resolves contradictory information using defined strategies
- **Graph Synthesizer**: Constructs the knowledge graph from aggregated data
- **Consistency Checker**: Ensures graph integrity through validation rules

### 4. Storage and Query Layer
- **Graph Database**: Stores the constructed knowledge graph
- **Query Interface**: Provides methods to retrieve information from the knowledge graph
- **Data Export Module**: Enables exporting graph data in various formats

### 5. Orchestration and Monitoring
- **Workflow Manager**: Coordinates the execution of mapping and reducing tasks
- **Resource Allocator**: Manages computational resources for optimal performance
- **Monitoring System**: Tracks system performance and data processing metrics

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Raw data is collected from various sources and preprocessed
2. **Mapping**: Preprocessed data is analyzed to extract entities and relationships
3. **Intermediate Storage**: Extracted information is stored in key-value format
4. **Reducing**: Key-value pairs are aggregated and conflicts are resolved
5. **Graph Construction**: The knowledge graph is constructed from aggregated data
6. **Storage**: The graph is stored in a graph database for querying and analysis

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python (primary), Java (for performance-critical components)
- **Distributed Computing**: Apache Spark for distributed data processing
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for storing and querying the knowledge graph
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy and NLTK for entity and relationship extraction
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn and TensorFlow for enhanced entity recognition

### Supporting Technologies
- **Data Storage**: HDFS or S3 for large-scale data storage
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for handling data streams
- **Containerization**: Docker for deployment consistency
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing distributed components
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring

## Interfaces

### External Interfaces
- **Data Source API**: For connecting to external data sources
- **Query API**: For retrieving information from the knowledge graph
- **Admin Interface**: For monitoring and managing the system

### Internal Interfaces
- **Mapper-Reducer Interface**: Defines how mappers pass data to reducers
- **Storage Interface**: Standardizes interactions with the graph database
- **Monitoring Interface**: Collects metrics from all system components

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: System designed to scale by adding more nodes
- **Parallel Processing**: Mapping and reducing operations executed in parallel
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data cached for improved performance
- **Batch Processing**: Large datasets processed in configurable batches
- **Incremental Updates**: Support for adding new data without reprocessing existing data

## Security and Data Governance

- **Access Control**: Role-based access to system components and data
- **Data Lineage**: Tracking of data sources and transformations
- **Privacy Compliance**: Mechanisms for handling sensitive information
- **Audit Logging**: Recording of system operations for accountability

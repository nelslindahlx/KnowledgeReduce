# KnowledgeReduce: Enhanced Web Crawling and Database Growth

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive refinement of the KnowledgeReduce technique, originally designed for extracting, processing, and organizing data from web sources into a knowledge graph. Our analysis identified several limitations in the original implementation, which we have addressed through a series of enhancements focused on improving web crawling capabilities and database growth mechanisms.

The refined solution offers significant improvements in scalability, data quality, and knowledge graph richness. Our test implementation successfully demonstrated these enhancements by crawling multiple Wikipedia pages and constructing a knowledge graph with 358 nodes and 3944 edges, showcasing the system's ability to extract, process, and organize web content into a structured knowledge base.

## Original Technique Analysis

The original KnowledgeReduce technique, as implemented in CivicHonorsKGv18.ipynb, provided a basic framework for knowledge graph construction with the following components:

1. **Web Scraping**: Limited to two hardcoded websites with basic HTML element extraction
2. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Simple fact storage without sophisticated relationship modeling
3. **Data Cleaning**: Basic deduplication and filtering of facts
4. **Serialization**: Basic JSON serialization for portability

While functional, this implementation had several limitations that restricted its scalability, flexibility, and overall effectiveness.

## Identified Improvement Areas

Our analysis identified ten key areas for improvement:

1. **Limited Website Crawling Scope**: The original technique only scraped two hardcoded websites
2. **Basic HTML Element Extraction**: Only extracted text from basic HTML elements (p, h1-h6, li)
3. **Limited Content Processing**: Treated each HTML element as a separate fact without contextual relationships
4. **Basic Deduplication**: Used simple string matching and similarity for deduplication
5. **No Incremental Updates**: Performed a complete scrape each time
6. **Limited Scalability**: Processed all data in memory
7. **No Rate Limiting or Politeness**: No delay between requests
8. **Limited Error Handling**: Basic error handling for HTTP requests
9. **No Content Categorization**: All facts categorized as "General"
10. **Limited Knowledge Graph Relationships**: Facts stored independently without explicit relationships

## Enhanced Crawling Strategy

To address these limitations, we developed an enhanced crawling strategy with the following components:

### 1. Recursive Crawling with Depth Control

```python
class EnhancedCrawler:
    def __init__(self, start_urls=None, max_depth=2, max_pages_per_domain=100):
        self.start_urls = start_urls or []
        self.max_depth = max_depth
        self.max_pages_per_domain = max_pages_per_domain
        self.visited_urls = set()
        self.url_queue = deque()
        self.domain_page_counts = defaultdict(int)
        self.user_agent = 'KnowledgeReduce Crawler/1.0'
        self.delay = 1  # seconds between requests to same domain
        self.last_request_time = {}  # domain -> timestamp
```

This component enables:
- Dynamic expansion to new websites by following links
- Configurable crawl depth to control exploration scope
- Domain-based limits to prevent overloading specific sites
- Rate limiting for polite crawling
- Robots.txt compliance

### 2. Enhanced HTML Element Extraction

```python
class ContentExtractor:
    def __init__(self, site_specific_rules=None):
        self.site_specific_rules = site_specific_rules or {}
        
    def add_site_rule(self, domain, selectors):
        """Add site-specific CSS selectors for content extraction."""
        self.site_specific_rules[domain] = selectors
```

This component enables:
- Site-specific extraction rules for targeted content retrieval
- Structured content extraction including titles, dates, authors
- Hierarchical content relationships preservation
- Support for diverse HTML structures beyond basic elements

### 3. Advanced Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction

```python
class EntityRelationshipExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load spaCy model with NER capabilities
        self.nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")
        
    def extract_entities(self, text):
        """Extract named entities from text."""
        doc = self.nlp(text)
        entities = []
        
        for ent in doc.ents:
            entities.append({
                'text': ent.text,
                'label': ent.label_,
                'start': ent.start_char,
                'end': ent.end_char
            })
            
        return entities
```

This component enables:
- Named entity recognition for identifying people, organizations, locations
- Relationship extraction to create connections between entities
- Subject-verb-object triple extraction for fact representation

## Database Growth Mechanisms

To support sustainable database growth and knowledge graph expansion, we implemented several mechanisms:

### 1. Adaptive Crawling Frequency

```python
class AdaptiveCrawler:
    def calculate_next_crawl_time(self, url, change_frequency=None):
        """Calculate when a URL should be crawled next based on its change history."""
        # Get crawl history
        history = self.get_crawl_history(url)
        
        if not history or len(history) < 2:
            # Not enough history, use default frequency
            if change_frequency:
                return time.time() + self.base_frequency[change_frequency]
            return time.time() + self.base_frequency['medium']
```

This mechanism:
- Analyzes content change patterns to optimize crawl scheduling
- Prioritizes frequently changing content
- Reduces unnecessary crawling of static content
- Balances resource usage with content freshness

### 2. Content Categorization and Tagging

```python
class ContentCategorizer:
    def categorize_text(self, text):
        """Categorize text into predefined categories."""
        doc = self.nlp(text)
        scores = {category: 0 for category in self.categories}
        
        # Calculate similarity with each category
        for category, category_vector in self.category_vectors.items():
            similarity = doc.similarity(category_vector)
            similarities[category] = similarity
```

This mechanism:
- Automatically categorizes content using NLP techniques
- Extracts relevant tags for improved searchability
- Organizes knowledge by topic and domain
- Enables more targeted knowledge retrieval

### 3. Knowledge Graph Expansion

```python
class KnowledgeGraphExpander:
    def find_entity_connections(self):
        """Find connections between entities across different sources."""
        cursor = self.db.conn.cursor()
        
        # Get all entities
        cursor.execute('SELECT id, text, entity_type FROM entities')
        entities = cursor.fetchall()
```

This mechanism:
- Identifies connections between entities across different sources
- Infers new relationships based on existing ones
- Clusters similar entities to consolidate information
- Integrates with external knowledge sources for enrichment

### 4. Database Sharding and Scaling

```python
class DatabaseSharding:
    def __init__(self, base_path, shard_size=10000):
        self.base_path = base_path
        self.shard_size = shard_size
        self.main_db = sqlite3.connect(os.path.join(base_path, "main.db"))
        self.setup_main_db()
```

This mechanism:
- Implements database sharding for horizontal scaling
- Manages fact distribution across multiple database files
- Provides unified query interface across shards
- Enables handling of very large knowledge graphs

### 5. Fact Verification and Quality Scoring

```python
class FactVerifier:
    def verify_fact_by_frequency(self, fact_id):
        """Verify a fact based on its frequency across sources."""
        cursor = self.db.conn.cursor()
        
        # Get the fact statement
        cursor.execute('SELECT fact_statement FROM knowledge_facts WHERE id = ?', (fact_id,))
        fact_statement = cursor.fetchone()[0]
```

This mechanism:
- Verifies facts based on multiple sources
- Assigns confidence scores to knowledge graph entries
- Prioritizes high-quality information
- Improves overall knowledge graph reliability

## Test Implementation Results

We developed a test implementation to validate our enhancements, which demonstrated:

1. **Successful Crawling**: The system crawled 5 Wikipedia pages with depth control
2. **Entity Extraction**: Identified 104 entities across multiple types (100 PERSON, 2 ORG, 2 GPE)
3. **Content Processing**: Extracted 324 content elements and generated 254 knowledge facts
4. **Relationship Identification**: Found 4 explicit relationships and 100 entity co-occurrences
5. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Built a graph with 358 nodes and 3944 edges

The test implementation successfully queried facts about specific topics, demonstrating the system's ability to retrieve relevant information from the knowledge graph.

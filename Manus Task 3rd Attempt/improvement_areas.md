# Improvement Areas for KnowledgeReduce Technique

Based on the analysis of the CivicHonorsKGv18.ipynb notebook, I've identified several areas where the KnowledgeReduce technique can be enhanced for improved web crawling and database growth:

## 1. Limited Website Crawling Scope
- **Current Implementation**: The technique only scrapes two hardcoded websites.
- **Limitation**: Cannot dynamically expand to new websites or follow links within websites.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Implement recursive crawling with depth control to follow links and expand the knowledge base.

## 2. Basic HTML Element Extraction
- **Current Implementation**: Only extracts text from basic HTML elements (p, h1-h6, li).
- **Limitation**: Misses content in other HTML structures like tables, divs with specific classes, or dynamic content.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Enhance the HTML parsing to target site-specific elements and extract structured data.

## 3. Limited Content Processing
- **Current Implementation**: Treats each HTML element as a separate fact without contextual relationships.
- **Limitation**: Loses semantic connections between related content on the same page.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Implement hierarchical content extraction that preserves relationships between headings and their content.

## 4. Basic Deduplication
- **Current Implementation**: Uses string matching and spaCy similarity for deduplication.
- **Limitation**: May remove semantically different facts that use similar wording.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Implement more sophisticated entity recognition and fact comparison algorithms.

## 5. No Incremental Updates
- **Current Implementation**: Performs a complete scrape each time.
- **Limitation**: Cannot efficiently update the knowledge base with only new information.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Add change detection and incremental updates to avoid redundant processing.

## 6. Limited Scalability
- **Current Implementation**: Processes all data in memory.
- **Limitation**: Will encounter memory issues with large datasets.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Implement database storage with efficient indexing for large-scale knowledge graphs.

## 7. No Rate Limiting or Politeness
- **Current Implementation**: No delay between requests.
- **Limitation**: May overload websites and get blocked.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Add configurable rate limiting and respect for robots.txt.

## 8. Limited Error Handling
- **Current Implementation**: Basic error handling for HTTP requests.
- **Limitation**: May fail completely if one website is unavailable.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Enhance error handling and implement retry mechanisms.

## 9. No Content Categorization
- **Current Implementation**: All facts are categorized as "General".
- **Limitation**: Difficult to organize and query specific types of information.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Implement automatic content categorization using NLP techniques.

## 10. Limited Knowledge Graph Relationships
- **Current Implementation**: Facts are stored independently without explicit relationships.
- **Limitation**: Cannot represent complex relationships between facts.
- **Improvement Opportunity**: Implement relationship extraction to create a more connected knowledge graph.

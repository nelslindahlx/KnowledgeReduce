# Enhance KnowledgeReduce: Transform a Python Knowledge Graph Project

## Context
I have a Python project called KnowledgeReduce (https://github.com/nelslindahlx/KnowledgeReduce) that implements knowledge graph functionality with BERT-based question answering. After a comprehensive code review, I've identified several areas for improvement to align with modern best practices. I need your expertise to implement these improvements, starting with foundational enhancements.

## Project Overview
KnowledgeReduce consists of:
- A Python package (`knowledge_graph_pkg`) using NetworkX for graph representation
- Multiple Jupyter notebooks demonstrating knowledge graph creation and BERT QA
- Basic implementation of reliability ratings for knowledge facts
- Web scraping and text processing capabilities using NLTK and spaCy

## Your Mission
Transform KnowledgeReduce into a professional-grade, well-documented, and maintainable Python package by implementing Phase 1 improvements from our enhancement plan.

## Specific Tasks

### 1. Documentation Overhaul
- Create a comprehensive README.md with:
  * Clear project description and purpose
  * Installation instructions with dependency information
  * Usage examples with code snippets
  * API overview and architecture explanation
  * Contribution guidelines
- Add Google-style docstrings to all classes and methods
- Create standalone example scripts demonstrating core functionality

### 2. Code Organization
- Standardize notebook naming with a consistent pattern
- Add clear headers to all notebooks explaining their purpose and relationship
- Mark deprecated notebooks and reference their replacements
- Create a proper `requirements.txt` with pinned dependencies
- Implement a development roadmap in the repository

### 3. Testing Framework
- Implement comprehensive pytest test suite covering core functionality
- Achieve at least 80% code coverage for the `knowledge_graph_pkg`
- Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD with automated testing
- Add test documentation explaining the testing approach
- Implement property-based testing for critical components

### 4. Package Structure Enhancement
- Refactor `setup.py` with proper metadata and versioning
- Implement semantic versioning
- Organize code into logical modules with clear responsibilities
- Create proper package initialization with meaningful imports
- Add type hints throughout the codebase

## Deliverables
1. A fork of the repository with all improvements implemented
2. Pull request with detailed description of changes
3. Documentation of design decisions and implementation approach
4. Test coverage report
5. A demonstration notebook showcasing the improved functionality

## Evaluation Criteria
Your implementation will be evaluated based on:
1. Code quality and adherence to Python best practices
2. Comprehensiveness and clarity of documentation
3. Test coverage and robustness
4. Maintainability and extensibility of the codebase
5. Backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Technical Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use modern Python features (Python 3.8+)
- Implement proper error handling with informative messages
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Consider performance implications, especially for large graphs

## Stretch Goals (if time permits)
- Implement basic performance benchmarking
- Add visualization enhancements using Plotly or Pyvis
- Create a simple CLI interface for basic operations
- Add export functionality to standard formats (RDF, JSON-LD)

This is the first phase of a larger improvement plan. Your work will establish the foundation for future enhancements including advanced NLP integration, scalability improvements, and semantic reasoning capabilities.

# Manus Task: Implement Improvements to KnowledgeReduce Project

## Task Description

I need assistance implementing improvements to my KnowledgeReduce project, a Python-based knowledge graph and question-answering system. The project currently provides functionality for creating knowledge graphs from text content and integrating BERT-based question answering, but requires enhancements to improve code quality, documentation, and features.

## Project Details

- **Repository**: https://github.com/nelslindahlx/KnowledgeReduce
- **Current State**: The project contains a Python package (knowledge_graph_pkg) for knowledge graph functionality and multiple Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different implementations.
- **Technologies**: Python, NetworkX, NLTK, spaCy, BERT, matplotlib

## Implementation Plan

Please implement the improvements outlined in the attached implementation todo list, focusing first on Phase 1 Foundation Improvements:

1. **Documentation Enhancements**
   - Create a comprehensive README.md with project description, installation instructions, and usage examples
   - Add proper docstrings to all classes and methods in the knowledge_graph_pkg
   - Create standalone usage examples

2. **Code Organization**
   - Standardize notebook naming conventions
   - Mark deprecated notebooks
   - Create a requirements.txt file with all dependencies

3. **Testing Implementation**
   - Set up pytest framework
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Configure GitHub Actions for continuous integration

4. **Package Structure Improvements**
   - Enhance setup.py with proper metadata and version management
   - Organize modules logically with proper imports

## Deliverables

1. A fork of the repository with all Phase 1 improvements implemented
2. Pull request with the changes
3. Documentation of the improvements made
4. Test results showing code coverage

## Guidelines

- Follow Python best practices for code style and organization
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Prioritize improvements based on the implementation plan
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Include tests for all new and modified functionality

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:
1. All Phase 1 tasks in the implementation todo list are completed
2. Documentation is comprehensive and clear
3. Tests pass with good coverage
4. The package structure follows Python best practices
5. The code is more maintainable and user-friendly

## Additional Context

This is the first phase of a larger improvement plan. Future phases will focus on technical enhancements, advanced features, and user experience improvements. The goal is to transform this project into a robust, maintainable, and feature-rich knowledge graph solution that aligns with current best practices in the field.

   - Traditional techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) are being enhanced with LLMs
   - Modern approaches use hybrid techniques combining rule-based and AI-driven methods
   - Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality results

3. **Data Validation and Quality**
   - Robust data governance frameworks define policies and standards
   - Automated validation tools like KGValidator help ensure data consistency
   - Regular data cleaning removes duplicates and corrects errors

4. **Scalability Solutions**
   - Sharding splits datasets for parallel processing
   - Indexing enhances retrieval speed
   - Automated ETL processes simplify data management

5. **Integration with LLMs**
   - Large Language Models are revolutionizing knowledge graph construction
   - LLMs automate entity extraction and relationship identification
   - Graph embeddings represent entities and relationships as vectors in continuous space

# Link Collection Improvements for CivicHonorsKG

Based on the analysis of the current notebook implementation, the following improvements are needed for link collection:

## Current Limitations

1. **Fixed URL List**: The notebook only scrapes two hardcoded URLs without any mechanism to discover additional relevant pages.
2. **No Link Extraction**: The current implementation doesn't extract or follow links from the scraped pages.
3. **No Depth Control**: There's no way to control how deep the scraping should go (e.g., following links up to a certain depth).
4. **No URL Filtering**: No mechanism to filter which links to follow based on relevance or domain.
5. **No Visited URL Tracking**: No tracking of already visited URLs to prevent duplicate scraping.

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Link Extraction Function**: Add a function to extract all links from a page.
2. **URL Queue Management**: Implement a queue system to manage URLs to be scraped.
3. **Depth Control**: Add parameters to control how many levels deep to follow links.
4. **Domain Filtering**: Add ability to restrict link following to specific domains or subdomains.
5. **URL Normalization**: Implement URL normalization to prevent duplicate scraping of the same content.
6. **Visited URL Tracking**: Maintain a set of already visited URLs to prevent cycles.
7. **Robots.txt Compliance**: Add respect for robots.txt files to ensure ethical scraping.
8. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading target servers.
9. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for network issues and invalid URLs.
10. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract and store metadata about links (anchor text, context, etc.).

These improvements will significantly enhance the knowledge graph by allowing it to discover and incorporate information from a broader range of relevant sources, rather than just the two predefined URLs.

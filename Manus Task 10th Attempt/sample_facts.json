George Frederickson\u00a0entitled Concepts of Civil Society. During the Concepts of Civil Society class, my collegiate interests focused on civic engagement.\u00a0At one point during the class, Dr. Frederickson posed a question to the class about what colleges could do to get people involved within the community. Over the course of the next year thinking about the idea of civil society, I became interested in pursuing a degree in the field of public administration. Thanks to the faculty of the Public Administration Department at the University of Kansas, I decided to endeavor to enter graduate school. I would like to thank Dr. Raymond Davis for advice and guidance, Dr. Thomas Longoria\u00a0for defining the importance of collaboration, and Dr. H. George Frederickson\u00a0for a thoughtful introduction to the world of civil society.",

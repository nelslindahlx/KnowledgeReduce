# Page Search Improvements for CivicHonorsKG

Based on the analysis of the current notebook implementation, the following improvements are needed for page searching functionality:

## Current Limitations

1. **Basic Text Extraction**: The current implementation only extracts text from p, header, and li elements without any targeted search capabilities.
2. **No Content Filtering**: No mechanism to filter content based on relevance to specific topics.
3. **No Semantic Understanding**: The extraction doesn't consider the semantic meaning or context of the content.
4. **No Structured Data Extraction**: No capability to extract structured data like tables, lists, or specific data formats.
5. **No Search Within Pages**: No functionality to search for specific information within collected pages.
6. **Limited Element Selection**: Only extracts from a predefined set of HTML elements.

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Keyword-Based Search**: Implement functionality to search for specific keywords or phrases within pages.
2. **Content Relevance Scoring**: Add a system to score content based on relevance to Civic Honors topics.
3. **Semantic Search**: Implement semantic search capabilities using the already included sentence-transformers.
4. **Structured Data Extraction**: Add functions to extract structured data like tables and forms.
5. **CSS Selector Support**: Allow for more precise content targeting using CSS selectors.
6. **Regular Expression Search**: Add support for regex-based content extraction for complex patterns.
7. **Entity Recognition**: Leverage spaCy's NER capabilities to identify and extract specific entity types.
8. **Context Preservation**: Maintain the context around extracted facts to improve understanding.
9. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract metadata like publication dates, authors, and categories.
10. **Content Classification**: Automatically classify content into predefined categories.
11. **Search Result Ranking**: Implement ranking of search results based on relevance.
12. **Cross-Page Information Linking**: Connect related information found across different pages.

These improvements will enhance the knowledge graph's ability to not just collect pages but to intelligently search within them for relevant information, extract it in a structured way, and organize it meaningfully within the knowledge graph.

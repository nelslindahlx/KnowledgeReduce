# KnowledgeReduce: Key Concepts and Requirements

## Core Principles

1. **MapReduce Adaptation**: KnowledgeReduce adapts the MapReduce paradigm specifically for knowledge graph construction, transforming the traditional map and reduce phases to handle the complexities of knowledge representation.

2. **Stackable Knowledge**: The framework enables the creation of stackable sets of knowledge, allowing for hierarchical organization and differentiation of knowledge. This is a key innovation that helps organize and build upon existing knowledge structures.

3. **Entity and Relationship Extraction**: The mapping phase identifies entities (nodes) and their relationships (edges) from diverse data sources using sophisticated parsing techniques.

4. **Aggregation and Conflict Resolution**: The reducing phase consolidates information about the same entities from different sources, resolving conflicts and refining the graph structure.

5. **Scalability and Distributed Processing**: The framework inherits MapReduce's scalable architecture and introduces optimizations for knowledge graph construction, leveraging distributed computing resources.

6. **Flexibility and Domain Adaptability**: KnowledgeReduce can be tailored to various domains and data types without significant restructuring, making it versatile for diverse applications.

## Architecture Components

1. **Data Ingestion and Preparation**:
   - Multi-source integration (structured, unstructured, and real-time data)
   - Data preprocessing, normalization, and cleaning
   - Schema mapping and entity recognition

2. **The Mapping Phase**:
   - Entity and relationship extraction
   - Intermediate representation (tuples or structured objects)
   - Disambiguation techniques
   - Distributed processing for handling large datasets

3. **The Reducing Phase**:
   - Aggregation and conflict resolution
   - Graph synthesis (node and edge creation)
   - Ensuring graph integrity
   - Consistency checks and validation rules

4. **Knowledge Stacking Mechanism**:
   - Hierarchical organization of knowledge
   - Differentiation between knowledge layers
   - Integration of new knowledge with existing structures

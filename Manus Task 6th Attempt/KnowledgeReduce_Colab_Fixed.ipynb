    "# KnowledgeReduce Implementation for Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements the KnowledgeReduce framework for building stackable knowledge repositories. It demonstrates the core concepts from the paper, including the mapping phase, reducing phase, and knowledge stacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation includes the following components:\n",
    "1. **Data Ingestion**: Loading and preprocessing data\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Mapping**: Entity and relationship extraction\n",
    "3. **Knowledge Reduction**: Entity resolution and graph synthesis\n",
    "4. **Graph Storage**: In-memory graph representation\n",
    "5. **Query Interface**: Tools for querying and analyzing the knowledge graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by installing the required dependencies."

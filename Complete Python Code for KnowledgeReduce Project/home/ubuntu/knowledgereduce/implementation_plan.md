# KnowledgeReduce Implementation Plan

Based on the missing components analysis, I'll implement the following features to create a fully functional KnowledgeReduce package:

## Phase 1: Core Functionality Implementation
- [x] Analyze existing code structure
- [x] Identify missing components
- [ ] Create proper package structure
- [ ] Implement JSON serialization with sharding support
- [ ] Enhance quality score calculation
- [ ] Improve relationship management
- [ ] Implement stackable knowledge sets

## Phase 2: Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement complete ETL pipeline
- [ ] Add conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Enhance visualization capabilities
- [ ] Optimize performance for large graphs

Let's start with creating the proper package structure and implementing the core functionality.

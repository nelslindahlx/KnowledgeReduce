# KnowledgeReduce Code Structure Analysis

## Overview
After examining the repository structure and code files, I've identified two main implementations:

1. **Original Implementation** (`knowledge_graph_pkg/`):
   - Basic `KnowledgeGraph` class with minimal functionality
   - Limited to adding, getting, and updating facts
   - No quality score calculation, relationship handling, or import/export functionality

2. **Enhanced Implementation** (`Mantus Batch File Download/ubuntu/knowledgereduce/implementation/`):
   - More complete implementation with multiple modules
   - Comprehensive framework with visualization, analysis, query capabilities
   - Integration module that ties everything together

## Key Components in Enhanced Implementation

### Core Module (`core.py`)
- `ReliabilityRating` enum for fact reliability classification
- `KnowledgeGraph` class with:
  - Quality score calculation
  - Fact management (add, update, get)
  - Relationship handling
  - Import/export functionality (GEXF, GraphML)
  - Search capabilities

### Analysis Module (`analysis.py`)
- Functions for analyzing knowledge graphs:
  - Identifying central facts
  - Finding fact clusters
  - Calculating fact similarity
  - Analyzing fact categories
  - Finding paths between facts

### Visualization Module (`visualization.py`)
- Functions for visualizing knowledge graphs:
  - Overall graph visualization
  - Fact neighborhood visualization
  - Graph statistics generation

### Query Module (`query.py`)
- `KnowledgeQuery` class for flexible querying
- Functions for pattern matching and relationship queries
- Related fact discovery

### Utils Module (`utils.py`)
- Web scraping functionality
- Entity extraction from text
- Knowledge graph creation from text/URLs
- Graph merging capabilities

### Integration Module (`integration.py`)
- `KnowledgeReduceFramework` class that integrates all components
- High-level API for working with knowledge graphs
- Simplified interfaces for common operations

## Jupyter Notebook Implementation
The `CivicHonorsKGv18.ipynb` notebook contains:
- A similar `KnowledgeGraph` implementation
- A `KnowledgeGraphPortable` class for serialization
- End-to-end pipeline for data extraction and graph construction

## Comparison with Paper Requirements
The enhanced implementation aligns well with the theoretical framework described in the paper:
- Map phase is represented by entity extraction and relationship identification
- Reduce phase is implemented through data aggregation and graph synthesis
- Quality scoring and relationship handling are implemented
- Visualization and analysis capabilities are provided

## Next Steps
Based on this analysis, I'll now identify the missing components that need to be implemented to create a fully functional Python package that meets all the requirements described in the paper.
